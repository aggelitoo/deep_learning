Welcome to my deep learning repo! Projects are from the course in deep learning (MT7042) given at Stockholm university fall 2024.

**Most noteworty:**\
Project 4: attempt at using a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) in order to generate novel images of Bulbasaurs. This project was a bit of a fail in terms of the actual fit of the model (the training/validation curve is not good...), but it was fun and we still learnt a lot.\
Click [here](https://github.com/aggelitoo/deep_learning/blob/master/project4/project4_report.pdf) for the report, or [here](https://github.com/aggelitoo/deep_learning/blob/master/project4/project4_presentation.pdf) for the presentation.
